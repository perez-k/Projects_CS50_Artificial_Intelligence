## Topics covered
ðŸ“š Topics Covered include:

0. Search \
[Lecture notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/0/), [Files](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/0/) \
Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move. \
Uninformed search (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) -  Informed search (Greedy Best-First Search [use heuristic function], A* Search [use heuristic and cost estimation]) - Adversarial search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-Limited Minimax)

2. Knowledge \
[Lecture notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/1/), [Files](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/) \
Representing information and drawing inferences from it.
Propositional Logic with logical connector [not(Â¬P); and(P âˆ§ Q); or(P âˆ¨ Q); implication(P â†’ Q); biconditional(P â†” Q)]

4. Uncertainty \
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

5. Optimization \
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a betterâ€”or the bestâ€”way to solve it.

6. Learning \
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

7. Neural Networks \
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

8. Language \
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
